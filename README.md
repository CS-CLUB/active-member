Computer Science Club Active Member Page
========================================

The Computer Science Club Active Member Page is a simple page where
club members can enter their credentials to verify that they are still
active in the club and haven't graduated, etc.

Currently the main purpose of the active member page is to get a list of
active members to submit to the SA for Co-Curricular Recognition CCR.
